# Word-Counter-app
## Overview
Though it says that it is a **word** counter app. Actually I didn't only counted words, I have counted *letters*, *symbols*, *numbers*, and *spaces*.
### Features
1. you can copy a bunch of text and *paste* it into the input text field.
2. you can reset what you have written or pasted in the *text* field
3. whatever you have written or pasted in the **textarea** javascript will count the *word*, *letter*, *symbol*, *number*, and *space*.
4. if you want to see how many times a letter occurred, you can click on the more button after letter counter.
5. if you want to see how many times a number occurred, you can click on the more button after number counter.
6. this is also **mobile responsive**
